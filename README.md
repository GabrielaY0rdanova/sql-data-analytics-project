# 📊 SQL Data Analytics Project

[![TSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-Data%20Analytics-blue?logo=Microsoft-SQL-Server)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server)

## ✨ Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of **T‑SQL scripts for data analytics and reporting**.  
The scripts demonstrate a variety of analytical techniques that are commonly used by **data analysts and BI professionals** when exploring and extracting insights from relational data.

This project is based on a **step‑by‑step guided SQL analytics tutorial by [Data With Baraa](https://www.youtube.com/@DataWithBaraa)**, and uses the datasets provided in the tutorial. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 📁 What's Inside

The repo includes:

📂 **datasets/** – Raw datasets used for running the SQL analytics scripts  
📂 **scripts/** – T‑SQL scripts demonstrating different analytical techniques

Each script focuses on a specific analytical theme, such as:

- 📈 Changes over time
- 📊 Cumulative metrics
- ⚡ Performance analysis  
- 🔍 Data segmentation
- 🧩 Part‑to‑whole analysis

These are common scenarios in real‑world analytics and business reporting.

## 📌 How to Use

1. **Import the dataset(s)** into your SQL Server database.  
2. Open the SQL scripts in the [`scripts/`](scripts) folder using **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** or another SQL client.  
3. Execute each script to explore analytical patterns and outputs.

Each script is self‑contained and focuses on a specific type of analysis.
